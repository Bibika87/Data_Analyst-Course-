
Hello and Welcome to this repository

This space is dedicated to the Data Analyst course that I attended from May 2023 to January 2024.

The course curriculum includes the following technologies and topics mastered by me:

- Data Structure
- Business Intelligence
- Excel
- Power Query
- Power Pivot
- DBMS
- SQL
 -Python
- Google Analytics
- Looker Studio
- Power BI
- Data Model
- Data Visualisation
- Data Literacy
- Data Structure & Algorithms
- AI & Prompt Design

This path has taught me a lot, from managing stress and tiredness as I attended the course after work every day for 8 months to my ability to manage data in many areas.

I learned to program in another programming language.
I developed my big data management skills and expanded my data visualization capabilities.

This course was a great personal challenge that taught me that if you want, you can.
